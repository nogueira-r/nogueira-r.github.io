    <p>My name is Rodrigo Nogueira, and I recently graduated from Fairleigh Dickinson University with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Computer Science, and a minor in Mathematics. I am excited to embark on a rewarding career in software development and currently seeking a full-time position or part-time internship in this field.

    Throughout my academic journey, I have undertaken a diverse range of projects that have allowed me to sharpen my skills and showcase my passion for programming. Here are a few notable projects I worked on throughout my educational journey that highlight my capabilities:

    <p><a href="../projects/android">Android Contacts Database App</a></p>I developed an intuitive Android application using Android Studio, leveraging an SQL database to efficiently store and query names. This project enabled me to gain hands-on experience in building user-friendly mobile applications.

    <p><a href="../projects/gradebook">Student Gradebook Database Website</a></p>I created a dynamic website utilizing the MVC framework in Visual Studio, where I integrated an SQL database to store and manage student grades. This project honed my web development skills and taught me the importance of organizing data effectively.

    <p><a href="../projects/asteroid">Asteroid Video Game</a></p>I designed and developed an engaging video game using DirectX 11 and Visual Studio. This project allowed me to explore the realm of game development and apply my programming expertise in a creative and interactive way.

    <p><a href="../projects/voice">Voice Synthesis AI Model</a></p>In collaboration with a partner, I contributed to a research project focused on Neural Networks. While my partner researched, I trained an AI model and created inferences for voice synthesis. This experience deepened my understanding of AI technologies and showcased my ability to collaborate effectively within a team.

    <p><a href="../projects/retail">Retail App Design</a></p>Using Adobe XD, I designed an aesthetically pleasing app tailored for a retail clothing brand. This project allowed me to exercise my creativity, user interface design skills, and demonstrate an understanding of the retail industry's needs.

    I believe my academic background, combined with my practical experience in these projects, positions me well to contribute to a dynamic software development team. If you have any opportunities available or would like to discuss my work further, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
